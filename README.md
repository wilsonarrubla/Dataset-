# Early Prediction of Failure Risk in a University Engineering Course

Student drop-out is a prevalent issue in education systems, where students definitively abandon their studies due to poor academic performance or forced withdrawal. Despite the attempts to address this issue through stricter academic monitoring and opportunities for remedial activities, there is a need to develop ICT-supported solutions that enable the timely identification of students who may be at risk of dropping out.This article compares the performance of cross-validation and ensemble evaluation methods for predicting course approval rates in e-learning settings. It also examines the impact of a national government policy, the Generaci√≥n E (GE) program, and shares the dataset with the scientific community to foster collaborative research and advancements in this field.The CRIS-DM methodology is used in this study, which is widely employed in data mining and provides a structured framework for ensuring reproducibility. The findings suggest that external evaluation may provide greater reliability for quality metrics in small datasets, albeit with higher computational costs. Random Forest (RF) demonstrates a good performance with an accuracy of 80%, followed by Tree Decision with an accuracy of 73%.Furthermore, the results of chi-square and logistic regression tests indicate a negative association between the GE program and course approval rates, with 69% of students benefiting from the program failing the course compared to those who do not benefit from it.
